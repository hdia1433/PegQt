This is my first full C++ application. 
It was made using CMake and Qt.
It is a simple peg game. 
To play peg, you try to jump pegs over other pegs, similar to checkers, to have only 1 peg left. I
In this version, blue indicates a peg, grey indicates a space, a light colour indicates that a piece has a valid move, and you can click on it; a dark colour indicates that you cannot.

(I promise there is also a win screen, I'm just bad at the game XD).

To build, you go to the project root in your terminal/command line, then go into the build folder and run make. To run it, just run the generated binary.
